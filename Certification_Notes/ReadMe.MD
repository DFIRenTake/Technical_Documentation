This will be the main spot where I will put notes related to hands-on technical training such as Try Hack Me, HTB, and other Certifications like CYSA+. 

Plans for future certifications is to earn the THM SOC 1 and SOC 2 certifications to gain hands-on experience with the tools and techniques covered by the CYSA+ exam. 

Once I obtain the THM certificates, I plan to move onto the cysa+.
