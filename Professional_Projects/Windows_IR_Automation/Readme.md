This project was initiated after attending two workshops provided by Patterson Cake at Black Hills Information Security. 

In his lectures, a wide variety of items were covered, but all items related to creating an effective incident response framework. Additional notes from the lectures will be added here,
as well as the code that I have created to establish such a practice in my enterprise environment.
